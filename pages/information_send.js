        <p>
          As the COVID-19 entered Indonesia weeks ago, we realized that it has affected  the economics condition in our country. 
          Inevitably, it creates an insanely exchange rate fluctuation and ended with a devaluation on Rupiah against USD, EUR, and GBP specifically. 
          It has come to our concern that we have to make a movement since we know that many of the customers are scholars that need to send money overseas for living cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, during the next 2 weeks Transfree has decided to make #sendforliving movement to enable people sending money without fee and with mid-market rate. 
          We will not take profit from this social movement so we hope if you or someone you know need it, letâ€™s join us and please help to spread the good news!
        </p>
        <p>
          please note:
          The stock for #sendforliving is limited based on availability. It comes with first come first serve basis. 
          However we will try to get as much stock as possible to serve all the demand.
